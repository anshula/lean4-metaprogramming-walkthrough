#doc (Post) "Introduction" =>

This is a tutorial on metaprogramming, or equivalently, writing tactics to help prove math theorems, in Lean 4.

# Code
- Here is the [full code](http://google.com) containing everything in the tutorial.
- Here is a [short "cheet sheet"](http://google.com) containing helper functions you might find useful when metaprogramming in the future.
